This is a batch query/retrieve interface for the CareStream PACS at Lausanne University Hospital.

#How to use : 

# Query/Retrieve : 
## Command line : 

 - Run the command : python pacsman.py --info info --save save --queryfile path_to_queryfile
 - The --info info option allows you to dump the information in the retrieved series into csv files.
 - The --save save option allows you to save the queryed dicom images.
 - The --queryfile path_to_queryfile option is mandatory and specifies which queryfile to use to query/retrieve.

Note : you can download the images without the --info option or only dump the info if --save option is not included.

 - Running the command above will download the dicom images by default into data folder of the project folder. 
 - You can specify the output directory by adding the option --out_directory path_to_output_directory.
 - You can also specify a different config file by adding the option --config path_to_config_file.

## Query file: 

The query file is a csv file that should include one or many of these column names : 
- StudyDate : The study dates of this column should be in the format YYYYMMDD (e.g 19900912 which indicates the 12th of September 1990)
- StudyTime : The study time should be in the format HHMMSS (e.g 140500 which means 14:05:00)
‚Åª SeriesDecription : The series description.
- PatientID :  The patient ID 
- ProtocolName : The protocol names.
- StudyInstanceUID : The Study Instance UID.
- PatientName : The patient name. (It is not recommanded to use this filter since there is no clear norm on how the patient names were stored on the pacs server)
- PatientBirthDate : Similarily to the Study Date 
- SeriesInstanceUID : The Series Instance UID
- ImageType : The image type as stored in the pacs server. (Note : using this filter significantly slows down the querying process. Use it only if absolutely necessary.)
