PACSMAN is a batch query/retrieve interface for the CareStream PACS at Lausanne University Hospital.

# Installation

PACSMAN is a Python application running on Ubuntu Linux, relying on the DCMTK suite of tools.

1. Install dcmtk `sudo apt-get install XXX CODE_HERE`
2. Download and install miniconda: `wget ... http://XXX/XXX.sh`, then `chmod u+x XXX.sh; ./XXX.sh`
3. XXX HOW TO OBTAIN THE CODE? GIT CLONE? XXX
3. Create a new python 3.6 environment using the yml file provided `conda create XXX`
4. Setup the configuration file (see below)
5. Verify the installation works by running this test: `XXX_TEST_WITH_EXAMPLE_CSV_HERE`


## Config file : 

The config file is a json file that should include the keys : 
- `server_ip` (the server IP)
- `port` (the port)
- `AET` (The current station's application entity title)
- `server_AET` (The server's application entity title).

The AET and corresponding IP of the workstation should be declared on Carestream, including the storeable attribute.

# Running queries 
## Command line : 

	python pacsman.py --info info --save save --queryfile path_to_queryfile

 - The --info info option allows you to dump the information in the retrieved series into csv files. XXX what does `info` as the argument to `--info` mean? isn't --info just a switch?
 - The --save save option allows you to save the queryed dicom images. XXX same question here
 - The --queryfile path_to_queryfile option is mandatory and specifies which queryfile to use to query/retrieve.

Note : you can download the images without the --info option or only dump the info if --save option is not included.
o
 - Running the command above will download the dicom images by default into data folder of the project folder. 
 - You can specify the output directory by adding the option --out_directory path_to_output_directory.
 - You can also specify a different config file by adding the option --config path_to_config_file.

## Query file: 

The query file is a `.csv` file that should include one or many of these column names : 
- StudyDate : The study dates of this column should be in the format YYYYMMDD (e.g 19900912 which indicates the 12th of September 1990). <br> Note : Querying on a date range is supported. (e.g 20150201-20160201 will query on studies between 01/02/2015 and 01/02/2016 ) 
- StudyTime : The study time should be in the format HHMMSS (e.g 140500 which means 14:05:00)
‚Åª SeriesDecription : The series description.
- PatientID :  The patient ID 
- ProtocolName : The protocol names.
- StudyInstanceUID : The Study Instance UID.
- PatientName : The patient name. (It is not recommanded to use this filter since there is no clear norm on how the patient names were stored on the pacs server)
- PatientBirthDate : Similarily to the StudyDate the date should be in format YYYYMMDD. Querying on date range is not supported for patient birth date.
- SeriesInstanceUID : The Series Instance UID
- ImageType : The image type as stored in the pacs server. (Note : using this filter significantly slows down the querying process. Use it only if absolutely necessary.)
- Modality : The modality.

Notes : 
- The query file could include one or many of the columns mentioned above. 
- If a line in a csv file contains an empty string on a particular columns, then, the query will not include the attribute corresponding to the column in question.
- The querying does not accept the value `*` alone on any attribute. However it can be used as a wildcard 
if other characters are provided, e.g. `ProtocolName` could be set to `BEAT_SelfNav*`

The query file can be built in Excel and exported to comma-separated values `.csv` format.

### Example : 

#### Example 1 : 

	StudyDate,PatientID
	20150512,123421
	,45322
	20180102,

A csv file like the one written above will retrieve:
- Images correspoding to study done on 12/05/2015 and for patient with patientID 123421.
- Images of patient with patient ID 45322.
- Images of studies done the 02/01/2018.

#### Example 2 : 

	StudyDate,patientID
	20150512,123421

The query for the csv file described above will fail since the column name patientID does not correspond to any allowed column mentioned above. (patientID should be PatientID)

#### Example 3 : 

	StudyDate,PatientID
	20150512,*

The query for this csv file will fail because querying with values * is not allowed.

#### Example 4 : 

	StudyDate,PatientID
	20150512-20150612,124588

Using this csv file, the query will retrieve images of the patient with patient ID 124588 and Study date between 12/05/2015 and 12/06/2015.

#### Example 5

	ProtocolName,Modality,PatientBirthDate
	BEAT_SelfNav\*,CT,19920611

This csv file will retrieve all the images with ProtocolName starting with BEAT_SelfNav, Modality CT and of Patients whose birthdays are on  11th of June 1992.

# Anonymization : 
## Command line : 
	python anonymize.py files-directory anonymized-files-directory
 - files-directory is the path to the folder that contains all the dicom images.
 - anonymized-files-directory is the path to the directory where the anonymized dicom images will be saved.

## Important Notes : 
 - If the anonymized-files-directory is the same as the files-directory the raw dicom images will be deleted and replaced by the anonymized ones (This proved useful when there was no more storage space left for additional images ).
 - The files-directory must contain the following structure : 
 	- The files-directory must contain subject folders with names that start with sub- (e.g. sub-123456). In any other case, the script will run but won't affect the data in any way.
 	- A subject folder must contain session folders with names that start with ses- (e.g. ses-20150423110533). In any other case, the script will run but won't have any effect on the dicom images.
 	- A session folder must contain other folders which contain only the dicom images to be anonymized. If the folders within the session folder contain another kind of file the program will crash. The session folder however, can contain any other files (not folders) and it won't affect the program.

 - The anonymized-files-directory must exist on the computer.

## Example :

### Example 1 :  
 	python anonymize.py ~/data ~/anonymized_data

 Running this command will anonymize the dicom files within the data folder and save them into anonymized_data folder.

### Example 2 : 
	python anonimyze.py ~/data ~/data 

Runnning the command above will replace all the images within data folder with anonymized ones.

# Converter : 

## Command line : 

	python converter.py path_to_data_folder 

path_to_data_folder is the path to the data to be converted to nifti format. The structure of the data should be exactly the same way as for the anonymization.
